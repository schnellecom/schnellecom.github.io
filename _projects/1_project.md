Simplicial Surfaces Package for GAP. I rewrote some of the functionality as part of the "Fachpraktikum/Practical Training Algebra". I will continue to work on it as part of a student assistant position at the Chair of algebra and representation theory, starting in April 2023.
Here you can find my fork of the package:
